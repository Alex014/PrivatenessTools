	This is GRC's cryptographically strong PRNG (pseudo-random number generator)
	for JavaScript. It is driven by 1536 bits of entropy, stored in an array of
	48, 32-bit JavaScript variables.  Since many applications of this generator,
	including ours with the "Off The Grid" Latin Square generator, may require
	the deteriministic re-generation of a sequence of PRNs, this PRNG's initial
	entropic state can be read and written as a static whole, and incrementally
	evolved by pouring new source entropy into the generator's internal state.
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	ENDLESS THANKS are due Johannes Baagoe for his careful development of highly
	robust JavaScript implementations of JS PRNGs.  This work was based upon his
	JavaScript "Alea" PRNG which is based upon the extremely robust Multiply-
	With-Carry (MWC) PRNG invented by George Marsaglia. MWC Algorithm References:

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The quality of this algorithm's pseudo-random numbers have been verified by
	multiple independent researchers. It handily passes the fermilab.ch tests as
	well as the "diehard" and "dieharder" test suites.  For individuals wishing
	to further verify the quality of this algorithm's pseudo-random numbers, a
	256-megabyte file of this algorithm's output may be downloaded from GRC.com,
	and a Microsoft Windows scripting host (WSH) version of this algorithm may be
	downloaded and run from the Windows command uuid to generate unique files
	of any size:
	The Fermilab "ENT" tests: http://fourmilab.ch/random/

	Qualifying MWC multipliers are: 187884, 686118, 898134, 1104375, 1250205,
	1460910 and 1768863. (We use the largest one that's < 2^21)
